Purdue AF features a JupyterLab interface with access to CPUs, GPUs, and
distributed computing resources via SLURM and Dask Gateway.
It features a software stack suitable for all steps of
HEP analysis design and execution, including popular tools such as
``coffea``, ``ROOT``, ``RDataFrame``, as well as popular
machine learning packages like ``tensorflow``. 
Users are provided with a variety of data access methods
(``XRootD``, ``XCache``, ``Rucio``), as well as multiple
private and shared storage volumes.

The software and functionality is regularly updated to provide state-of-the-art
tools and features for fast, efficient, collaborative HEP research.
