    **Updated: January 17, 2025**

    The Purdue EOS storage servers are down since December 23, 2024.

    All EOS directories are affected, including ``/store/user``, ``/store/data``, and ``/store/mc``.
    
    CMS datasets can still be accessed from other CMS sites via XRootD or XCache.
    Datasets with the only copy at T2_Purdue, as well as any private data at EOS
    are not accessible at the moment; we hope to recover all data by January 19th.

    Outputs of CRAB jobs executed since December 23rd are stored on fallback servers,
    please contact the site support if you need to access them.

    All other storage (``/home/``, ``/work/``, Depot) remains fully operational.

    We will keep you updated on the progress of the recovery.

Purdue Analysis Facility
======================================

The Purdue Analysis Facility is designed to provide an interactive environment
for fast and scalable CMS physics analyses using dedicated computing resources at Purdue.

Purdue AF features a JupyterLab interface with access to CPUs, GPUs, and
distributed computing resources via SLURM and Dask Gateway.
It features a software stack suitable for all steps of
HEP analysis design and execution, including popular tools such as
``coffea``, ``ROOT``, ``RDataFrame``, as well as popular
machine learning packages like ``tensorflow``. 
Users are provided with a variety of data access methods
(``XRootD``, ``XCache``, ``Rucio``), as well as multiple
private and shared storage volumes.

The software and functionality is regularly updated to provide state-of-the-art
tools and features for fast, efficient, collaborative HEP research.
