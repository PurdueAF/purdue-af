Contributing to documentation
===============================

This website is rendered from documentation in the
`Purdue AF GitHub repository <https://github.com/PurdueAF/purdue-af/tree/master/docs>`_.

To contribute to documentation, please **open a pull request**.


- The website uses `ReadTheDocs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ platform
which runs on `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ engine.

- The visual theme and layouts of the website are implemented via `furo <https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo>`_ package.

- The documentation uses `RST syntax <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ 
which provides many features such as customizable code blocks, cross-referencing, tables, etc.,
but is very sensitive to indentation and has a learning curve.
