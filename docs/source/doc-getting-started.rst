      ðŸš€ Login to Purdue Analysis Facility
   </a>

Choose a login method
------------------------

* Purdue University account - recommended if you are a Purdue user
* CERN account (CMS users only)
* FNAL account

Select resources
------------------------

After a successful login, you will be redirected to a page
where you can select the number of CPU cores, RAM, and GPUs for your session.

The default values are enough to get started; if more resources are needed,
you can close the session (``Shut Down`` button in top right corner) and
recreate it with a different selection.

.. important::

   There are two options for GPU selection:

   * 5GB "slice" of Nvidia A100 GPU - immediately available, but less powerful
   * Full 40GB instance of Nvidia A100 GPU - more powerful, but subject to availability

.. tip::
   
   If for any reason the session creation fails but you need urgent access to your files,
   use ``Minimal JupyterLab interface`` option.
